#Git

A distributed version control system, where every user has a complete and full copy of the source code.  

If you can't check it in, you can't keep track of it, so you can't version it, so you can't automate it.

*Everything* belongs in source code control, and git is the standard in 3rd platform.

Other possible options: subversion (svn), mercurial (hg), Perforce (p4), ClearCase (cc).

---

##GitHub?

A freemium service to host Git repositories (repos). Public repos are free, private ones are still cheap.

Most open source projects are hosted and collaborated on here.

> If you're not on GitHub you don't exists.
-- Friendly developer

#CloudFoundry CLI

A command line tool for managing CloudFoundry applications and related services.  Again, all CLI so that it can be scripted and automated.

Simple commands to deploy, scale and monitor applications.

---

#Slack

Think of it like IRC on 'roids'. Team chat with multiple channels, integrations with services like GitHub, Trello, etc.

Often used to significantly replace email within Agile teams.

---

#Trello

An online 'Kanban' board to track tasks and completion.

Very simple and user friendly, can be used for anything from sprint management to planning a birthday party.
