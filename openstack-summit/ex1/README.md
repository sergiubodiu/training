#Cloud Foundry on OpenStack Hands-On Labs

##Exercise 1: Target the Cloud Foundry instance

Make sure you've installed the stackato CLI for accessing the Cloud Foundry instance.

Target the Cloud Foundry instance by substituting the URL with the one provided.

```
cf target https://api.15.125.77.39.xip.io
```

The output should look something like below.

```
Successfully targeted to [https://api.15.125.77.39.xip.io]
Target:       https://api.15.125.77.39.xip.io
Organization: workshop-org
Space:        workshop-space
```

You can verify the applications running with the following command.

```
cf apps
```

and the services that are installed with the following command.

```
cf marketplace
```

You should see an output that lists the different services and the plans that have been pre-installed for your convenience.

```
